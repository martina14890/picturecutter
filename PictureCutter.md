PictureCutter is a software to cut out parts from lots of digital images (photographies) quick and easy. The PictureCutter is concentrating on the creative part of the work, the cutting. The PictureCutter has an automated processes to save the selected parts in various configurations. These various configurations can be set by the user itself.

The idea of the program surface is that the creative inovation will be increased. So you'll find no buttons or menues. The properties or any special functions will be accessed with the contextmenu (rightclick).

The PictureCutter can be used to prepare images for the online development in a lab, preparation of images for online galleries, blogs, printouts, flyers, and so on...

Since february 2007 there is a blog on blogger where i put in more general information, but also news about whats happening. [PictureCutterBLOG ](http://picturecutter.blogspot.com)

'''[01-01-2010](UPDATE.md) Since the Novel hosting is not available anymore, the move to google source is an ongoing task.'''

'''[19-11-2008](UPDATE.md) There is a complete restructuring of the project ongoing, but it requires more time than expected and less time than expected is available due to my studies in digital design and integration. The restructuring will bring separated projects, threaded thumbnail loading as well as the start of an api for extensions.'''


## Project Roadmap ##
